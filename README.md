The Smart parking System Project help us to find the availability of parking slot.
The system uses infrared (IR) sensors to determine whether a parking space is occupied.
If a parking space is available, the gate will open; otherwise, the gate will remain closed.
The system will turn on the corresponding LED if the parking slot is occupied; otherwise, the LED will remain off.

Components Required for Car Parking System: Arduino Uno, Servo Motor, IR Sensors, LED, Connecting Wires
